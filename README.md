# Weather Journal

This project is the 3rd  for my **Udacity Nano-Degree** program in *Front-End Web Development*. It focuses on using an API to get information from a remote server, couple that information with user inputted data and dynamically update a web page with the data entered. I did do some styling but I kept that to a minimum as it wasn't the focus of the excercise.
In this application you enter your ZIP code as well as how you are feeling today. Once done press the 'Generate' button and it will create a journal entry containing the current date, temperature and your feelings.
While the site is quite simple there was a lot of work to be done to create a server, gather data from the API and user, POST that data to the server and GET the data to be inserted back from the server and inserted into the HTML of the page.
